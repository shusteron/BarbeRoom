### Our platform serves two main user profiles: barbers and clients. Below is a brief overview of the features available to each user type:

## For Clients:

### 1) Appointment Booking:

Clients can easily make appointments by selecting a barber, choosing a suitable day from the barber's working schedule, picking an available time slot, and specifying their desired haircut type.

### 2) View Upcoming Appointments:

Clients have access to a clear overview of their upcoming appointments, ensuring they stay informed about their scheduled visits.

### 3) Appointment History:

Clients can review their past appointments, allowing them to keep track of their haircut history and preferences.

### 4) Cancel Appointments:

In case of any changes in plans, clients have the flexibility to cancel their current appointments directly through the platform.

## For Barbers:

### 1) Shift Management:

Barbers can efficiently manage their working shifts by organizing their availability based on desired days and dividing them into morning and evening shifts as needed.

### 2) View Work Schedule:

Barbers have access to a comprehensive overview of the work schedules of all barbers, including themselves.

#### Our web application aims to streamline the appointment scheduling process for both clients and barbers, providing a user-friendly experience that enhances communication and organization within the barbering community.

#### Note: This is a brief summary of the features available in our web application. For detailed instructions on how to use each feature, please refer to the documentation provided in the repository.
